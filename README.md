This is a simple SPA project in order to ilustrate Angular-.NET communication.

In terms of backend, I am using .NET with EntityFramework Core for ORM in order to interect with the db.

For the frontned, I am using Angular with clasic Angular Material UI installed for used components.

If you want to run this project make sure that:
- you have  version of SQL Server installed on your computer
- Run "update-database" in order to create the database ( Replace the server in the connection string with the corresponding name of you sql server instance )
- run the backend (using an IDE, like VS)
- run the frontend ( using ng serve)
